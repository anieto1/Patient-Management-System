1. **Proto Definition:**
   - You've defined a `BillingService` with one RPC method: `CreateBillingAccount`
   - The service uses request/response messages: `BillingRequest` (patientId, name, email) and `BillingResponse` (accountId, status)

2. **Billing Service (gRPC Server):**
   - Implemented a gRPC server in the Billing Service using `@GrpcService` annotation
   - The server runs on port 9001 (configured in application.properties)
   - Implemented the `createBillingAccount` method that currently returns mock data

3. **Patient Service (gRPC Client):**
   - Created a gRPC client in the Patient Service to communicate with the Billing Service
   - The client connects to the Billing Service using the configured address and port
   - Implemented a method to create billing accounts by sending patient information

4. **Integration:**
   - The Patient Service calls the Billing Service when a new patient is created
   - The billing account creation is triggered as part of the patient creation workflow
   - Configuration is handled through environment variables (BILLING_SERVICE_GRPC_PORT)

5. **Dependencies:**
   - Added necessary gRPC dependencies to both services (grpc-netty-shaded, grpc-protobuf, grpc-stub)
   - Using the grpc-spring-boot-starter for integration with Spring Boot
   - Configured protobuf plugin for code generation

This implementation establishes a simple microservice communication pattern where the Patient Service creates billing accounts in the Billing Service via gRPC when new patients are registered.

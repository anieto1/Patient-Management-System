- An Api gateway acts as a single entry point for clients to interact with multiple microservices
- Routes requests to the microservices, hiding the internal address from the clients
- Handles concerns like authentication, authorization, logging, monitoring,
 rate limiting, and caching centrally, that are common to all


 - IN our current setups, expose our ports to the client when calling a rest request to the patient service,
 which becomes a security issue

 - As we increase the number of microservices, we will have to configure more ports to communicate with the services

 - With an api gateway, the client just communicates with the gateway, and the gateway will redirect to the appropriate microservice
 - It centralizes calls so the gateway can handle the rooting, hiding the internal addresses of services

 -can also handle authentication and authorization
